"""
Problem: Given two lists, write a program with a function that merges these two lists in descending order. Your main program will allow the user to enter two lists of numbers and end the program by inputting a blank line for list 1. You are not allowed to concatenate the two lists into a new list and then call the built-in sort() function to sort the new list in descending order. But you are allowed to sort the two lists in descending order before merge. Donâ€™t worry about the complexity of the merging algorithm.

List 1: 1 3 3 6
List 2: 1 4 5
[6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1]
List 1: 100
List 2: 1 1 3
[100, 3, 1, 1]

def merge(a, b):
    # res = [x for n in (a, b) for x in n] //list comprehensive method
    for i in b:
        a.append(i)
    res = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    final_res = [int(x) for x in res]
    print(final_res)


while True:
    list1 = input("List 1:").split()
    if len(list1) == 0:
        break
    list2 = input("List 2:").split()
    merge(list1, list2)
